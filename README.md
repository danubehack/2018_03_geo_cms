# GeoCMS
## Summary
Existing solutions for management of geospatial data and earth observation data≈à, i.e. geospatial content management system (GeoCMS) provide functionalities to upload datasets, describe them with metadata and show them on map. Data processing and analysis is not well supported.
This project, GeoCMS, is trying to overcome this deficiency. More specifically, we enabled upload of multiple datasets. We used vector data from GADM (https://gadm.org/) as a filter when fetching data via OGC WCPS service which provides Copernicus data. As a use cases we made analysis of population and land cover data. User is able to click on polygon (one of theree levels of GADM) and get Copernicus data for that polygon (average, min, max values).
## Motivation
- existing geospatial content management systems provide limited functionalities for data processing
- enable adding various data sources from GetCapabilities
- get the data from coverages via WCPS for selected polygon
- combine data from multiple coverages via WCPS, original idea pertained to night light correlated with population, due to lack of data shifted to infrared

## Target user groups
- Users requiring data manipulation and visualisation functionalities via web application
- Users wishing to combine data from multiple rastered sources
- Users interested in simple access to sentinel data

## Methodology
- Define reference data which will be used as a filter for WCPS queries (GADM world borders, levels 0, 1, 2)
- Import necessary data from Sentinel to WCS
- From WCS getCapabilities discover coverages
- Utilize WCPS for realtime processing on coverages, examples
-- aggregation of all population values within a polygon
-- correlation of population data with infrared levels

## Results
- Viewer allowing for on-the-fly aggregation of coverage data (population) based on polygons (NUTS)
- Automatically fetching the projection of coverage and reprojection to the projection of the viewer
- Aligning the projection of different coverages before calculation, then cross correlate (simple difference) between population and infrared
- Automatic reversal of coordinates due to different coverage setups (and bugs in the frameworks)
- Viewer for correlation of population data with infrared levels still in progress, time delay due to first setting up data services

## Challenges
- Copernicus data difficult to process, thus selected bands from LEVEL-2A pertaining to infrared data were imported to a WCS (bands 8a, 11, 12)
- Various reference systems require investing more effort to enable combining data
- Various ways to define coordinate order (N/E instead of E/N which OpenLayers supports by default)
- WCPS returns error when the selection polygon extends over the coverage extent
- WCPS poorly documented pertaining to crs transformation for on-the-fly merge of coverages with different projections
